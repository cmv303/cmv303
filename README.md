### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Since writing my first lines of code in November 2022, I've been constantly in awe as to how similar the process is to both filmmaking and teaching in a university setting. Filmmaking, researching, and educating are nothing if not continual reworkings. They naturally follow agile methodologies: all require feedback, problem-solving, individual and team-oriented focus, and making sure the big picture doesn't get lost in the details.

Pivoting and finding new ways to explain abstract ideas are my strong suits, and I'm thrilled to explore how best to expand this skill set within the tech sector.
